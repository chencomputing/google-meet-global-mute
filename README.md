# Google Meet Global Mute
This is the repository for a Chrome extension that provides a configurable way 
to mute meetings in Google Meet. The goal is to be easy and simple to use with
some configuration options for personal taste. A big problem with similar
extensions is that they force you in to a specific configuration such as
"always show notifications" or "always bring focus to the window on hotkey".
This is really not that ideal so let people configure this.
